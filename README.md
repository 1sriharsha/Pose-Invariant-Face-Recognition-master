Pose Invariant Face Recognition
This Project aims at the development of a robust face recognition system which is suitable in identifying faces irrespective of various alignments or poses of the face. Most of the existing algorithms in face detection are only successful in controlled environments and fail drastically when non linear functions such as pose variation, illumination and occlusion are affecting the image.

Getting Started
Convolutional Neural Networks is used in applying feature extraction to normalize the data causing the system to cope with faces subject to pose variation.

Objectives
Evaluate the performance of CNNs w.r.t. appearance-based facial analysis.

Investigate the robustness of CNNs against classical datasets like FERET, ATT, WEBCAM, etc.

Propose different CNN architectures designed for specific problems.

Extend the project to single sample based pose invariant face recognition.

Softwares & Tools Used

pandas

Future Scope
Besides obtaining a robust technique like CNN to classify pose variations in facial images, we are also trying to incorporate volumetric regression so that we can generate different poses with single image and then train them using the proposed architecture.

Since we know that the problems and challenges faced in facial recognition are inevitable, we were specifically dealing only with poses in this project. But in the near future we can expect many more advancements in this field considering the rapid growth in the field of Machine Learning.

CNN can also be used for large-scale video classification.Besides CNN, Deep learning techniques like Recurrent Neural Networks can be used to implement phase-sensitive and recognition-boosted speech separation.
